I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Software Engineering and Game Design and Development](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/swegd/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University](https://www.kennesaw.edu/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Lingming Zhang](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~lxz144130/). You can download my CV from [here](https://lx0704.github.io/files/CV-XiaLi.pdf).

<!--I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Jiangxi University of Science and Technology](http://e.jxust.edu.cn/) and two master's degrees in Management Science and Engineering from [Shandong Jianzhu University](https://xwzx2016.sdjzu.edu.cn/english/) and Information Technology and Management from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/)-->


# Research Interests

My research interests focus on Software Engineering, in particular: software testing and debugging involving dynamic/static program analysis.
