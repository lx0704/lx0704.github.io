I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Software Engineering and Game Design and Development](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/swegd/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University](https://www.kennesaw.edu/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Lingming Zhang](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~lxz144130/). 


# Research Interests

My research interests focus on Software Engineering, in particular: software testing and debugging, software maintenance
through machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

# Grants

"Towards an AI-powered and failed-tests-driven software debugger". Sponsored by Georgia Research Alliance, $46,227. (6/2025â€“12/2025)
